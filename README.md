# TraineesAI

**AI-driven training platform for engineering internees.**

AI teaches. AI tests. Human mentors. The training platform that takes the training burden off busy engineers and managers.

## What is this?

TraineesAI is the modernized successor to [ExaminerAI](https://github.com/fccljbplant/ExaminerAI). It's a Next.js SaaS platform designed for a specific problem in industry:

> When a new internee or trainee joins, engineers and management don't have time to train them. This platform shifts the training burden to AI — AI teaches, AI tests, AI tracks progress. The human mentor only steps in when AI flags a student needs help.
